[I](https://github.com/BertramGi1f0y1e) am a master at [East China Normal University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_China_Normal_University)(2022-2025), mentored by Prof. [TingSu](https://dblp.org/pid/42/6896-1.html). My research interests revolve around [static program analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis). I'm conducting static program analysis work on [HarmonyOS NEXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarmonyOS_NEXT) [APP](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/guidebook/harmonyecoapp-guidebook-0000001761818040) within [Ark Compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark_Compiler) at [Huawei](https://businessabc.net/wiki/huawei). In parallel, I'm also conducting [delta debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_debugging) work.

[Software Analysis, Testing and Verification - Fall 2023](https://tingsu.github.io/files/courses/pa2023.html)

During this period, I developed the [lab sessions](https://github.com/ecnu-sa-labs/ecnu-sa-labs) for the course based on the [cis547 course](https://software-analysis-class.org). Under the guidance of my advisor, I made some redesigns to it.

[Software Analysis, Testing and Verification - Fall 2024](https://tingsu.github.io/files/courses/pa2024.html)

During this period, I, along with my advisor and other team members, are continuing to improve the lab sessions.
